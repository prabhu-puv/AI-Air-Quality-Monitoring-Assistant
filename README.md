## ❓ Problem Statement
Air pollution is a serious urban challenge affecting public health and quality of life.
Although AQI data is available online, it is often difficult for common users to interpret.

**How might we use AI to analyze air quality data and provide clear health advisories
so that urban communities can reduce health risks and adopt sustainable practices?**

## 🤖 AI Solution Overview
The Air Quality Monitoring Assistant:
- Predicts AQI using a machine learning model  
- Classifies pollution levels  
- Generates health and safety advisories  
- Displays results using a Streamlit web interface  

The system focuses on awareness and decision support rather than medical diagnosis.
